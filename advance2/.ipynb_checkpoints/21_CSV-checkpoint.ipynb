    "# What Is a CSV File?\n",
    "A CSV file (Comma Separated Values file) is a type of plain text file that uses specific structuring to arrange tabular data. Because it’s a plain text file, it can contain only actual text data—in other words, printable ASCII or Unicode characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of a CSV file is given away by its name. Normally, CSV files use a comma to separate each specific data value. Here’s what that structure looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "column 1 name,column 2 name, column 3 name\n",
    "first row data 1,first row data 2,first row data 3\n",
    "second row data 1,second row data 2,second row data 3\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how each piece of data is separated by a comma. Normally, the first line identifies each piece of data—in other words, the name of a data column. Every subsequent line after that is actual data and is limited only by file size constraints.\n",
    "In general, the separator character is called a delimiter, and the comma is not the only one used. Other popular delimiters include the tab (\\t), colon (:) and semi-colon (;) characters. Properly parsing a CSV file requires us to know which delimiter is being used."

    "# Where Do CSV Files Come From?\n",
    "CSV files are normally created by programs that handle large amounts of data. They are a convenient way to export data from spreadsheets and databases as well as import or use it in other programs. For example, you might export the results of a data mining program to a CSV file and then import that into a spreadsheet to analyze the data, generate graphs for a presentation, or prepare a report for publication.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV files are very easy to work with programmatically. Any language that supports text file input and string manipulation (like Python) can work with CSV files directly."
