    "The expression `<_io.TextIOWrapper name='output.txt' mode='r' encoding='cp1252'>` refers to an instance of a file object in Python that has been opened using the `open()` function. Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`_io.TextIOWrapper`**: \n",
    "   - This indicates that the file is being handled in **text mode**, meaning the contents are being read or written as human-readable text (not binary data). \n",
    "   - The `TextIOWrapper` is a class that wraps around the raw file object and handles encoding and decoding between the file and Python's internal string representation.\n",

    "2. **`name='output.txt'`**: \n",
    "   - This shows the name of the file that was opened, which in this case is `'output.txt'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`mode='r'`**: \n",
    "   - The file is opened in **read mode** (`'r'`), meaning you are reading from the file. \n",
    "   - In this mode, the file must exist, or Python will raise a `FileNotFoundError`. You cannot write to the file when it is opened in this mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`encoding='cp1252'`**: \n",
    "   - This is the **character encoding** used to read from the file. \n",
    "   - `cp1252` (Windows-1252) is a common encoding used on Windows systems. It’s a superset of ASCII, handling most Western European languages. This specifies that the content of the file is being read using the `cp1252` encoding.\n",
