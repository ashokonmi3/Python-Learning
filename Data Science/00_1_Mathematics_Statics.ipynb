    "## 1. **Mean, Median, and Mode: Simple Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, the **mean**, **median**, and **mode** are three common ways to summarize data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 **Mean (Average)**:\n",
    "The **mean** is the average of a set of numbers. You find it by adding up all the numbers and then dividing by how many numbers there are.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: If you have the numbers [3, 5, 7], the mean is:\n",
    "  - Add them together: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15\n",
    "  - Divide by how many numbers there are: 15 ÷ 3 = 5\n",
    "  - So, the **mean** is 5.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Real-Life Analogy**: \"The mean is like finding the average of how much money people in a group have. If you want to know how much money, on average, everyone in a group has, you’d add up all their money and divide by how many people are there.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 **Median**:\n",
    "The **median** is the middle value when the numbers are sorted in order. If there is an odd number of values, the median is the middle one. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: If you have the numbers [1, 3, 5], the median is 3 (the middle number). For [1, 2, 3, 4], the median is:\n",
    "  - Add the two middle values: (2 + 3) ÷ 2 = 2.5\n",
    "  - So, the **median** is 2.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-Life Analogy**: \"The median is like finding the middle point of a race. Imagine you’re lining up runners based on their speed, and the runner in the middle is the **median** runner.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 **Mode**:\n",
    "The **mode** is the number that appears most frequently in the dataset. If more than one number appears the most number of times, the dataset is considered **multimodal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: In the set [1, 2, 2, 3, 4], the mode is 2 because it appears twice, more than any other number.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What if there are more than two modes?**  \n",
    "  If there are **more than two numbers** appearing **the same number of times**, the dataset is **multimodal**.\n",

    "  - 5 appears 2 times,\n",
    "  - 6 appears 2 times,\n",
    "  - 7 appears 2 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Since all of them appear the same number of times, **this dataset has four modes: 4, 5, 6, and 7**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-Life Analogy**: \"The mode is like finding the most common shoe color in a group of people. If most people wear red shoes, red is the mode.\"\n",

    "- **Median**: The middle value in the data.\n",

    "Bias happens when your darts consistently miss the bullseye but land in the same area (like to the left or right).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Bias**: You make big mistakes because you're not understanding the target correctly.\n",
    "- **Example**: You predict house prices using a simple rule, like \"$100 per square foot,\" ignoring other factors like location or age. Your predictions are consistently off.\n",

    "- **Low Variance**: Your model is consistent and stable.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5.1 **Probability**\n",
    "**Probability** is the chance or likelihood of something happening. In machine learning, we use probability to make predictions about events based on past data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-Life Analogy**: \"Imagine you have a bag of 10 marbles: 7 red and 3 blue. If you randomly pick a marble, the **probability** of picking a red one is 7 out of 10, or 70%. In machine learning, we use similar calculations to predict the likelihood of events, like predicting the weather or whether an email is spam.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-World Example**:\n",
    "  - Suppose you are predicting whether a customer will buy a product based on whether it’s a sunny or rainy day.\n",
    "  - From past data, you know that on sunny days, 70% of customers make a purchase, and on rainy days, only 30% do.\n",
    "  - If today is sunny, the probability of a customer making a purchase is 70%.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 **Correlation**\n",
    "**Correlation** tells us how two variables are related or if they change together in any way. It can be **positive**, **negative**, or **no correlation** at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-Life Analogy**: \"If you notice that when it’s hotter outside, people tend to buy more ice cream, this is a **positive correlation**. Both temperature and ice cream sales increase together. A **negative correlation** would be if, as the temperature goes up, the number of people in jackets goes down. In machine learning, we look for these relationships to make better predictions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-World Example**:\n",
    "  - **Data**: Suppose you have data showing the number of hours students study and their exam scores:\n",

    "    | 5              | 90         |\n",
    "\n",
    "    As the number of hours studied increases, the exam score also increases. This is a **positive correlation**.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 **Linear Relationship**\n",
    "A **linear relationship** occurs when two variables change in a constant way. In machine learning, this relationship is often modeled as a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-Life Analogy**: \"Imagine that you pay $10 for every pizza you buy. If you buy 1 pizza, it costs $10, 2 pizzas cost $20, and 3 pizzas cost $30. This is a **linear relationship** because the cost increases by the same amount for each pizza.\"\n",

    "- **Real-World Example**:\n",
    "  - **Data**: Suppose you have data showing the number of hours worked and the amount of money earned:\n",

For example, predicting a house's price based on its size using a linear relationship.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Real-Life Analogy**: \"Imagine you want to predict the **price** of a house based on its **size**. Regression helps you find the best formula to make that prediction. For example, you may find that each square foot of space adds $200 to the house price.\"\n",

    "    You can use regression to predict that a house of 1200 sq ft will cost around $240,000, based on the pattern in the data.\n",

    "### 5.5 **Classification**\n",
    "**Classification** is used when you want to assign an item to a category or class. Unlike regression, which predicts continuous values, classification predicts discrete categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-Life Analogy**: \"Think of sorting fruits into categories: apples, bananas, and oranges. Classification helps you decide whether a fruit is an apple, banana, or orange based on its features, such as color, shape, and size.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-World Example**:\n",
    "  - **Data**: Suppose you have data showing whether a customer bought a product or not, based on whether the day is sunny or rainy:\n",

    "    | Rainy    | No              |\n",

    "    Based on this, you can classify the likelihood of a customer buying the product depending on the weather. This is a **binary classification** (two classes: yes or no).\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **How it relates to Machine Learning**: In machine learning, classification is used for tasks like spam email detection (is the email spam or not?) and disease diagnosis (is the patient sick or healthy?).\n",
