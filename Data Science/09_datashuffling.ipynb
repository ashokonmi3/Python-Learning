    "# Data Shuffling for Non-Technical Students\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Data Shuffling is the process of randomly reordering the data in a dataset. This ensures that the model doesn't learn unintended patterns that are based on the order of the data. In machine learning, it's crucial to shuffle data to create a fair and unbiased training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is Data Shuffling Important?\n",
    "- **Prevents Learning Based on Order**: When a dataset is ordered (e.g., by time or another variable), the model may pick up on patterns that are tied to that order. Shuffling the data helps prevent this.\n",
    "- **Improves Model Generalization**: It ensures that the model gets trained on a more representative and diverse sample of the data.\n",
    "- **Avoids Overfitting**: If the data is ordered, the model might memorize the sequence rather than learn the underlying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example of Data Shuffling\n",
    "Imagine we have a list of students' exam scores ordered by their age:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Age: 10, 12, 13, 14, 15\n",
    "Score: 80, 85, 70, 90, 88\n"
