    "1. Emphasis on code readability, shorter codes, ease of writing\n",
    "2. Programmers can express logical concepts in fewer lines of code in comparison to languages such as C++ or Java.\n",
    "3. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, like object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural.\n",
    "4. There exists inbuilt functions for almost all of the frequently used concepts.\n",
    "5. Philosophy is “Simplicity is the best”."

    "\n",
    "Interpreted\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C and C++.\n",
    "* Directly runthe program from the source code.\n",
    "* Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes which is then translated into native language of specific computer to run it.\n",
    "* No need to worry about linking and loading with libraries, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Platform Independent\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system platforms.\n",
    "* Python can be used on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris and many more.\n",
    "* Free and Open Source; Redistributable\n",
    "\n",
    "High-level Language\n",
    "* In Python, no need to take care about low-level details such as managing the memory used by the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple\n",
    "Closer to English language;Easy to Learn\n",
    "More emphasis on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "* Embeddable\n",
    "Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the program’s users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust:\n",
    "* Exceptional handling features\n",
    "* Memory management techniques in built\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich Library Support\n",
    "* The Python Standard Library is vary vast.\n",
    "* Known as the “batteries included” philosophy of Python ;It can help do various things involving regular expressions, documentation generation, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, email, XML, HTML, WAV files, cryptography, GUI and many more.\n",
    "* Besides the standard library, there are various other high-quality libraries such as the Python Imaging Library which is an amazingly simple image manipulation library."
