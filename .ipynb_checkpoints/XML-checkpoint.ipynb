    "### What is XML?\n",
    "XML stands for \"Extensible Markup Language\". It is mainly used in webpages, where the data has a specific structure and is understood dynamically by the XML framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "XML creates a tree-like structure that is easy to interpret and supports a hierarchy. Whenever a page follows XML, it can be called an XML document.\n",
    "\n",
    "XML documents have sections, called elements, defined by a beginning and an ending tag. A tag is a markup construct that begins with < and ends with >. The characters between the start-tag and end-tag, if there are any, are the element's content. Elements can contain markup, including other elements, which are called \"child elements\".\n",
    "The largest, top-level element is called the root, which contains all other elements.\n",
    "Attributes are name–value pair that exist within a start-tag or empty-element tag. An XML attribute can only have a single value and each attribute can appear at most once on each element.\n",
    "To understand this a little bit "
